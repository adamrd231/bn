<h1>BARE NECESSITY</h1>
A Producitivity Tool
<hr>
<h4>WHY PAPER?</h4>
<p>Too long have we done what the crowd tells us to do instead of doing what we know to feel write. With the bare necessity, start remembering things in a way that we all know is already powerful, writing down and crossing off our tasks.</p>
<p>Remembering and focusing on what needs to be done today is a powerful tool, with the User Tasks feature, use a quadrant to focus in on a specfic area of your life. Daily tasks, habits, long term goals, etc...</p>
<p>Use the blank space in each quadrant to write down the things you need to remember, or things that you do not need to be thinking about right now.</p>
